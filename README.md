# Ultrasonic-Distance-Based-LED-Alert-System
This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and lights up the built-in LED when an object is detected within 100 cm. Itâ€™s a simple IoT system ideal for learning sensor-based control, with real-time distance data displayed via Serial Monitor. Perfect for beginners in Arduino and automation.
